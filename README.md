# The NebulaMC Network
_The Pixelmon server you call home since 2016_

## Quests &amp; Adventure and Survival Pixelmon server. 
Nebula is, like, _really_ old - and it's a pioneer of its kind; a Pixelmon adventure/survival hybrid. With countless features such as Player Gyms, Quests, MMO-esque Skills, Weekly Events, a huge wilderness map. It has always aimed higher, and strived for better. Through this wiki, we hope you will come to learn about more than the shiny plugins and fancy features - it's full to the brim of our server's history, our adventure map's lore, and the endless storylines that populate Nebula's continents - Vanha and Cualo.

## FAQ
* Is there an Enjin where I can find IPs, pictures, and latest news?
> No! And that's because we got something better. Enjin has historically bad displays and support, so our tracker has been redirected to [Github](https://github.com/NebulaMC-GG) (see below) and the Forums interactions are now through [Discord](https://discord.gg/D7bpV2rzjU). It's better that way- it makes it easier to post memes.

> Our [webshop](https://store.nebulamc.gg/) is tailored to suit the sparkly, shiny and fabulous you. We have 5 permanent paid ranks, a variety of crate keys, and cosmetic bundles to pretty up your gameplay. Secure checkout is done through Buycraft. Start shopping [here](https://store.nebulamc.gg/).
* Where can I report an issue or suggest an improvement to the server?
> We would adore you till the end of time if you would write up a nice ticket on [our tracker](https://github.com/NebulaMC-GG).
* Where would I find a Pixelmon guide? 
> The [PixelmonMod wiki](http://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) reigns supreme, and should always be used when you need to find information on PokÃ©mon, Pixelmon recipes, or mechanics you're unsure about.
* I still feel like a Charmander in the rain... lost and abandoned. Where do I get more help?

### Finding Your Logs 
When reporting a bug, glitch, timing out or disconnect, please make sure to submit your debug.log and latest.log as well. You can find these in your computer files. Check what launcher you are using, and follow the filepath to these files.

_WINDOWS_

> For the Minecraft Launcher : C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\logs

> For the Technic Launcher: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\.technic\modpacks\pixelmon-reforged\logs

> For the ATLauncher: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\ATLauncher\Instances\PixelmonCraft\logs

> For the Twitch Launcher: C:\Users\USER\Documents\Curse\Minecraft\Instances\PACK\logs

_macOS_

> Open 'Finder' on your taskbar. On the top bar, click on the 'Go' dropdown menu. Then click 'Go to Folder'. Type ~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft/bin. Then open your logs folder.

NOTES
- If you don't have a debug.log, it might be named just debug. Check again.
- If you don't have any "debug" file, update your modpack or install Forge 2705, if you are using the Minecraft Launcher.
- Minecraft ALWAYS has these files. If you really can't find them under that folder, make sure you have Forge or any modpack installed! If you need any more support, ask in our Discord #support channel!
